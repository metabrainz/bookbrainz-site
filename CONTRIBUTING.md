# Contributing to BookBrainz Site

If you're reading this, you're probably creating a Pull Request or planning to do so and that's great!

In order to keep that process as pleasant as possible for all parties and to maintain a nice repository,
please follow the steps below.

## Bug Tracker

We use the bug tracker at https://tickets.metabrainz.org/projects/BB to track issues with
the site or supporting BookBrainz libraries. If you find a problem, or are
looking for something to fix, please head there. We do not use GitHub issues.

## Code Style

We have a standard code style, and have an npm script set up to check that code
sticks to this style using eslint. Here as some basic style tips for contributing
to BookBrainz:

 * Beautiful, simple code is good - better to do a feature well than fast (see the Python Zen - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
 * Don't prematurely optimize - sacrificing good code for speed is rarely good
 * Use tabs for indenting, and spaces for aligning (http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/).
 * Variable names should be camelCase
 * Use ES6/ES7 features - they make life easier and result in cleaner code
 * Use [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) for commenting code
 * Use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) everywhere - static type checking is useful

## Pull requests

Please read carefully the [MetaBrainz Github guidelines](https://github.com/metabrainz/guidelines/blob/master/GitHub.md)

## Commits

We try to keep our commit messages readable and concise, this is especially important as they can't be rewrittenâ€”unlike
code. Commit messages should follow a standard format, detailed below.

Each commit should start with one of the following identifiers, which help people
to know the purpose of the commit.

 * `feat` - a new feature, or new functionality in the site
 * `fix` - a fix for an existing feature
 * `docs` - additions or changes to the documentation
 * `style` - fixing code style issues, or improving code readability
 * `refactor` - restructuring the code without changing functionality
 * `test` - adding or changing anything to do with tests
 * `chore` - updating dependencies, updating the build scripts
 * `other` - anything that doesn't fit into the above categories

Following this, you can optionally specify a component, in parentheses. Here
is a standard list of components for BookBrainz - you can use others if you wish:

 * `editor` - the entity editor
 * `profile` - the editor profile pages
 * `display` - entity display
 * `revision` - the revision page
 * `static` - the static content pages (e.g. about/contributing)
 * `search` - anything to do with search backend or frontend
 * `achievement` - the achievement system
 * `auth` - authentication, registration and login systems
 * `core` - server-side infrastructure not related to any of the above

So, combining these first two parts, you might end up with a commit message starting like this:

    feat(editor)

Next, you'll want to add a colon `:` followed by a short summary of the commit (less than 70 characters) - this should briefly describe the change. If you can't fit it into 70 characters, you've probably put too much into a single commit - try splitting the change into smaller chunks.

Finally, if you need to give more detail about the change or give any background information, leave a blank line, and then write a longer message. Wrap lines at 80 characters.

Here's an example of a complete commit message following these guidelines:

    feat(editor): introduce new input field for author birth date

    Everybody has a birth date, and this field allows editors to record the birth
    dates of authors they add to BookBrainz. Dates in ISO 8601 format
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) are accepted by the field.
