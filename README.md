<hr>
This repository contains the code for the BookBrainz web site. The directories
are arranged as follows:

* `config` - the config to be used when running the site; copy the example files
  and edit, dropping the `.example` suffix.
* `docker` - deployment files and configurations
* `scripts` - scripts used during the development and deployment of BookBrainz.
* `sql` - PostgreSQL database schemas and migration files—formerly separated in https://github.com/bookbrainz/bookbrainz-sql
* `src` - node.js source files defining the site logic and user interface.
* `static` - static files which are served by node as part of the site.
* `test` - unit tests and functional tests for the site.

Additionally, after building the client JavaScript (see below), the following
directories will exist:

* `lib` - compiled and minified server files
* `static/stylesheets` - the CSS generated from compiling the project LESS files
  (`src/client/stylesheets`).
* `static/js` - minified JavaScript files which are referred to by the site
  pages.

## Running BookBrainz with Docker

You can run BookBrainz locally using Docker, without needing to install Node.js or PostgreSQL manually.  
This is the recommended setup for quickly starting development or testing.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed

### Steps

All commands to run BookBrainz locally with Docker:

```bash
# Copy configuration files
cp config/config.json.example config/config.json
cp config/secrets.json.example config/secrets.json

# Build and start the containers
docker-compose up --build

# Stopping the containers
docker-compose down

# (Optional) Rebuilding containers after code changes
docker-compose up --build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

# Access the application
   Once the containers are up, the site should be running at:http://localhost:9099


### Notes
- Make sure ports 9099 (BookBrainz) and 5432 (Postgres) are free on your machine.

This Docker setup allows developers to quickly get a working BookBrainz instance without manual installation steps. 


## Beta and test subdomains

We have two separate subdomains for the purpose of testing and rolling out beta features.
You can sign in with the same account as the one you use on the main website.

__[beta.bookbrainz.org](https://beta.bookbrainz.org)__ uses the main database but with a newer version of the code that hasn't been released yet. It is used to test new features.

__[test.bookbrainz.org](https://test.bookbrainz.org)__: all changes made to this subdomain are not in sync with the main database and vice versa.
This domain is for you to tinker with all features of the website freely without having to verify the correctness of the data you enter. This comes in handy if that'a all you need to do instead of having to set up BookBrainz locally.
This subdomain is used for testing only and the data is not maintained or updated. It is not guaranteed that any of the data will be authentic.
